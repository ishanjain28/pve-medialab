<h1>PVE Medialab</h1>

This guide will help you create a suite of PVE CT's and applications for building a Home Media solution.

As with all our guides, we have an Easy Script to automate CT creation through to the installation of software.

But the first step is to check your network and hardware prerequisite requirements before running our Easy Script. It's important you first read and follow our prerequisite guide.

**Prerequisites**

Network Prerequisites:

- [ ] Layer 2/3 Network Switches

PVE Host Prerequisites:

- [x] PVE Host is configured to our [build](https://github.com/ishanjain28/pve-host-setup)
- [x] PVE Host Backend Storage mounted to your NAS

  - nas-0X-backup
  - nas-0X-books
  - nas-0X-downloads
  - nas-0X-music
  - nas-0X-photo
  - nas-0X-transcode
  - nas-0X-video

  You must have a running network File Server (NAS) with ALL of the above NFS and/or CIFS backend share points configured on your PVE host pve-01.

Optional Prerequisites:

- [ ] pfSense with working OpenVPN Gateways VPNGATE-LOCAL (VLAN30) and VPNGATE-WORLD (VLAN40).

<h4>Easy Scripts</h4>
Easy Scripts are based on bash scripting. Simply `Cut & Paste` our Easy Script command into your terminal window, press `Enter` and follow the prompts and terminal instructions. But PLEASE first read our guide so you fully understand the input requirements.

Our Easy Scripts assumes your network is VLAN ready. If not, simply decline the Easy Script prompt to accept our default settings ( i.e Proceed with our Easy Script defaults (recommended) [y/n]? enter 'n' ). You can then set your own PVE container variables such as IP address.

# 1. About our MediaLab CT Applications

All our MediaLab PVE CTs are built using the PVE Ubuntu 20.10 template.

Shared storage (NAS) is via CT bind mounts with your PVE host(s). All our MediaLab CT applications use our custom Linux User `media` and Group `medialab`.

For the Radarr, Sonarr, and Lidarr an out-of-the-box setting preset file is included. Go to the application WebGUI `System` > `Backup` and restore the backup filename:

> radarr_backup_v3.2.2.0000_0000.00.00_00.00.00.zip

Always test IP connectivity after installing all the Medialab Apps. The API should all be valid and working.

## 1.1. Unprivileged CTs and File Permissions

With unprivileged CT containers, you will have issues with UIDs (user id) and GUIDs (group id) permissions with bind-mounted shared data. In Proxmox UIDs and GUIDs are mapped to a different number range than on the host machine, usually, root (uid 0) became uid 100000, 1 will be 100001 and so on.

This means every CT file and directory will be mapped to "nobody" (uid 65534). This isn't acceptable for host mounted shared data resources. For shared data, we want to access the directory with the same, unprivileged, UID as is being used on all other CTs under the same user name.

Our default PVE Users (UID) and Groups (GUID) in all our MediaLab, HomeLab and PrivateLab CTs are common.

- user `media` (uid 1605) and group `medialab` (gid 65605) accessible to unprivileged LXC containers (i.e JellyFin, NZBGet, Deluge, Sonarr, Radarr, LazyLibrarian, FlexGet);
- user `home` (uid 1606) and group `homelab` (gid 65606) accessible to unprivileged LXC containers (i.e Syncthing, Nextcloud, Unifi);
- user `private` (uid 1607) and group `privatelab` (gid 65606) accessible to unprivileged CT containers (i.e all things private).

> Because some people use Synology DiskStations where new Group ID's are in ranges above 65536, outside of Proxmox ID map range, we must pass through our `medialab` (GUID 65605), `homelab` (GUID 65606) and `privatelab` (GUID 65607) Group GUIDs mapped 1:1.

Our fix is done in three stages in our Easy Scripts when you create any new MediaLab application CT.

### 1.1.1. Unprivileged Container Mapping - medialab GUID

To change a PVE containers mapping we change the PVE container UID and GUID in the file `/etc/pve/lxc/container-id.conf` after our Easy Script creates a new MediaLab application CT.

```
# Our CT mapping in /etc/pve/lxc/container-id.conf

lxc.idmap: u 0 100000 1605
lxc.idmap: g 0 100000 100
lxc.idmap: u 1605 1605 1
lxc.idmap: g 100 100 1
lxc.idmap: u 1606 101606 63930
lxc.idmap: g 101 100101 65435
# Below are our NAS Group GUIDs (i.e medialab,homelab) in range from 65604 > 65704
lxc.idmap: u 65604 65604 100
lxc.idmap: g 65604 65604 100
```

The above change is done automatically in our Easy Script.

### 1.1.2. Allow a CT to perform mapping on your PVE host

A PVE CT has to be allowed to perform mapping on a PVE host. Since CTs create new containers using root, we have to allow root to use these new UIDs in the new CT.

To achieve this we **add** lines to `/etc/subuid` (users) and `/etc/subgid` (groups). We define two ranges:

1. One where the system IDs (i.e root uid 0) of the container can be mapped to an arbitrary range on the host for security reasons; and,
2. Another where Synology GUIDs above 65536 of the container can be mapped to the same GUIDs on a PVE host. That's why we have the following lines in the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files.

```
# /etc/subuid
root:65604:100
root:1605:1

# /etc/subgid
root:65604:100
root:100:1
```

The above edits add an ID map range from 65604 > 65704 in the container to the same range on the PVE host. Next ID maps GUID 100 (default Linux users group) and UID 1605 (username media) on the container to the same range on the host.

The above edit is done automatically in our Easy Script.

### 1.1.3. MediaLab CTs use common UID and GUID

Our PVE User `media` and Group `medialab` are the defaults in all our MediaLab CTs. This means all new files created by our MediaLab CTs have a common UID and GUID so NAS file creation, ownership and access permissions are fully maintained within the Group `medialab`.

The Linux User and Group settings we use in all MediaLab CTs are:

(A) User media without a Home folder

```
groupadd -g 65605 medialab
useradd -u 1605 -g medialab -M media
usermod -s /bin/bash media
```

(B) User media with a Home folder

```
groupadd -g 65605 medialab
useradd -u 1605 -g medialab -m media
usermod -s /bin/bash media
```

The above change is done automatically in our Easy Script.

# 6. Flexget LXC

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

<!-- FlexGet is a multipurpose automation tool for all of your media. Support for torrents, nzbs, podcasts, comics, TV, movies, RSS, HTML, CSV, and more.

Filebot is installed to rename all Flexget downloaded media. You will require a Filebot license.

## 6.1. Easy Script installer
Our Easy Script will create your Ubuntu Flexget CT. Go to your Proxmox PVE host (i.e pve-01) management WebGUI CLI `>_ Shell` or SSH terminal and type the following (cut & paste):

```
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ishanjain28/pve-medialab/master/pve_medialab_ct_flexget_installer.sh)"
```

Simply follow our Easy Script installation prompts. We recommend you accept our defaults and application settings to create a fully compatible Medialab build suite.

## 6.2. Setup Flexget
Instructions to setup Flexget are [here](https://github.com/ishanjain28/flexget).

## 6.3. FileBot Installation
FileBot is a tool for organizing and renaming your Movies, TV Shows and Anime as well as fetching subtitles and artwork. It is the naming resolver for all Flexget downloaded media.

Filebot seems much better at resolving/guessing media which doesn't adhere to the TheTVdB or IMdB named convention. Its the best renaming solution for series like 60 Minutes and general documentaries.

Best to use the fully paid licensed version of this software - it's worth it.

Filebot is installed on the Deluge LXC container.

### 6.3.1. Create FileBot `Home` Folder
Filebot is installed on the Deluge LXC container. So using the Proxmox web interface go to `typhoon-01` > `113 (deluge)` > `>_ Shell` and type the following:

```
sudo mkdir /home/media/.filebot; sudo chown -R 1605:65605 /home/media/.filebot
```

### 6.3.2. Install FileBot
With the Proxmox web interface go to `typhoon-01` > `113 (deluge)` > `>_ Shell` and type the following:

```
apt install curl -y &&
bash -xu <<< "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filebot/plugins/master/installer/deb.sh)"
```

To check your FileBot installation is without errors type the following:
```
sudo -u media -H sh -c "filebot -script fn:sysinfo"

If you receive the following error, read on: `Unicode Filesystem` - **Unicode Filesystem: java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Malformed input or input contains unmappable characters: /root/.filebot/龍飛鳳舞**. First check you've completed Step 7.12. Finally if the unicode error persists after performing Step 7.12 then manually set your machine locale to `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` using the command (spavebar to select / tab to move to <ok>):
```
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```
This should resolve the unicode error issue.

### 6.3.3. Register and Activate FileBot
Go get yourself a license key for FileBot from [HERE](https://www.filebot.net/). You need it and its afforadable.

You will recieve your License Key via email and the activation instructions are available [HERE](https://www.filebot.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6121). Copy your FileBot_License_PXXXXXXX.psm License Key file to `/home/media/.filebot` folder. Or use nano and paste your key data into a new file. You **MUST** performed FileBot licensing under the 'media' user ID otherwise the software will not be licensed to run under the `media` user.

With the Proxmox web interface go to `typhoon-01` > `113 (deluge)` > `>_ Shell` and type the following:
